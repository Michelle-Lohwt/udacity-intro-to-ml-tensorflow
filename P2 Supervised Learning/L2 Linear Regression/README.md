## Topics discussed under Linear Regression

1. Mini Batch Gradient Descent
2. Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Regression (PolyFeature)
4. Regularization
5. Feature Scaling

## Recap
In this lesson, you were introduced to linear models. Specifically, you saw:

1. Gradient descent as a method to optimize your linear models.
2. Multiple Linear Regression as a technique for when you are comparing more than two variables.
3. Polynomial Regression for relationships between variables that aren't linear.
4. Regularization as a technique to assure that your models will not only fit to the data available, but also extend to new situations.
